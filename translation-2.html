<div class="interlude">
    <p>Duval was leafing through his daily report, freshly typed, in his room at the Hôtel Renaissance, 29 Bd Albert 1er, second floor. The name of a group of petty crooks—insignificant, mere marginalia—appeared there. His tired eyes slid past the page, his mind already elsewhere, pulled by the invisible threads intertwining in this Cold War.</p>

    <p>The Romanian delegation was staying in Monaco for a few days. In this neutral territory, bilateral discussions between Romania and Italy were ostensibly—to Eastern and Western observers alike—limited to agricultural trade, tourism, and university cooperation. But behind this facade, geopolitical stakes of a completely different magnitude were being played out.</p>

    <p>Since its creation a little over a year ago, the <i>CoCom</i> (“Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls,” no less), Washington has systematically locked down all industrial cooperation with (and consequently all technological transfer to) the Soviet bloc. These areas remain, officially, forbidden from discussion. The Italians, it was whispered backstage, were nursing other ideas. “In one way scandalous, in another, intolerably boring,” he thought.</p>

    <p>A real nuisance: it was often said that monitoring your friends required more finesse than monitoring your enemies.</p>

    <p>Another report awaited him on the left. After reading and initialing it, he pushed it toward the right corner of the desk with all the requisite professionalism. Paper in. Paper out.</p>

    <p>It was 4:50 PM. He finished his final report. This piece, expected at headquarters, would arrive—as always—a day late. The process was flawed: what arrived late could only leave late. But this superfluous report, like all the others, had to arrive on time: the boss, a petty tyrant and well-known incompetent in the service, tolerated no deviation.</p>

    <p>He mistyped the distribution code.<br>
        It read: EXT&#8209;0.<br>
        No such code.</p>

    <p>A small error that would force the mail service to check manually. Paradoxically, “erroneous” documents moved up the chain faster than perfectly formatted ones. A trick he had learned during his stint at the main office in Tunisia.</p>

<div class="chapter">
    <p>A voice called out from inside: “Hello! Hello… welcome.”</p>

    <p>It was an old four-story building. The living room and dining room were on the first, the family lived above that, and higher still were the children and guests.</p>

    <p>“Hello, Claire.”</p>

    <p>“Henri, this is Luka.”</p>

    <p>Monsieur Salmon crushed his hand quite violently. An ambush.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Henri Salmon led him to the living room. It was all in good taste. Luka’s gaze fell upon a tempestuous canvas hanging above the sofa.</p>

    <p>“What’s this?” Luka inquired, pointing to the wall.</p>

    <p>“Gustave Courbet’s <i>The Wave</i>; one of them, at least,” said Claire. “Henri’s aunt insisted we take it. I’m just starting dinner…”</p>

    <p>She vanished toward the kitchen.</p>

    <p>Luka let his gaze soak into the work. After a moment or two, a wry smile crept onto his face.</p>

    <p>“Ah, the sea—the true <i>Origin of the World</i>, isn’t it?”</p>

    <p><em>—</em></p>

    <p>Luka pivoted, embarrassed: “As Darwin used to say?”</p>

    <p>With hardly a hesitation, Henri countered: “Darwin must have been from Lyon then! Give a Darwinist a Monegasque soup, and you’ll see which one he judges primordial.” He pivoted in turn toward the kitchen. “Don’t you think, darling?”</p>

    <p>Well played, enough. Things continued in this fashion for a good many hours, with no end in sight.</p>

    <p>At one point, Henri rolled an enormous object to the center of the room while Luka wasn’t looking. Henri dragged him toward the thing.</p>

    <p>"Put that thing away," Claire implored, still preparing the table.</p>

    <p>The globe—proud, eighty centimeters of Swiss precision—sat enthroned. Apparently, Henri had just returned from Australia.</p>

    <p>Henri still had the tanned complexion from his trip—a liaison mission about which he said nothing, except for a few vague words about the red dust of the desert around Woomera, about the great wild dromedaries that had collided with their convoy at dusk, or about the red kangaroos, muscular boxers, every one of them. But about the rest, about why he was there, it was radio silence.</p>

    <p>“Are you familiar with this island?”</p>

    <p>“It’s the end of the known world. <i>Savvy</i>?” Luka replied.</p>

    <p>Henri frowned.</p>

    <p>“Tasmania, of course,” Luka conceded.</p>

    <p>“Well, very good!” said Henri, turning to the busy Claire. “He’s got a head on his shoulders, this one.”</p>

    <p>Shortly after, dinner arrived. Indisputably Provençal.</p>

    <p>Fresh salmon. Color… salmon-colored, obviously.</p>

    <p>Salt, pepper. Olive oil. Lemon.</p>

    <p>A few herbs, perhaps. A creamy sauce. Vegetables. Mostly green. Red wine. Dry. Expensive, no doubt.</p>

    <p>The Lyon sausage had been moved aside.</p>

    <p>Henri gave him a verbal guided tour of Monaco. The history. The history of his family. Luka nodded with the required vigor.</p>

    <p>Henri made a display of his confidential information.</p>

    <p>“The Grand Prix this year… you didn’t hear it from me, but it’s canceled. They’re arguing again about safety. For whom? Frankly, nothing’s changed: it’s a joke.”</p>

    <p>It was a secret to no one who opened a newspaper—and certainly not to someone who, until last week, had been writing one. Luka let it pass, though.</p>

    <p>“What a shame,” said Luka, echoing.</p>

    <p>Henri, encouraged, continued: “Canceling a race because the cars go too fast… it’s like canceling this dinner over the wine being too good.”</p>

    <p><em>Well.</em></p>

    <p>Between Henri’s stories—who was getting carried away, gesturing toward a lithograph of the Principality to illustrate the permanence of the Rock—Luka’s gaze escaped toward the <i>Tir aux Pigeons</i>, that tiny ink semicircle wedged between the immensity of the water and the line of steel. He was already there, in the metallic scansion of the trains—those that came to sweep the freshly ruined from the Casino’s feet, whisking them away to make room for fresh eyes.</p>

    <p>…</p>

    <p>Claire smiled.</p>

    <p>Praline tart—Luka’s old favorite.</p>

    <p>Claire spoke of another world. The old days in Lyon. Names, places. Things seen, things past. They joked and laughed. Even Henri.</p>

    <p>The glass had warmed him up a bit.</p>

    <p>Music was playing. Had he even noticed?</p>

    <p>“La Mer” by Trenet, no less. He sank into his chair.</p>

    <p>All was right, in the complete world.</p>
