    <p>The job in Monaco had gone south; his lost eye was surely mocking him from the clear, shallow waters off the coast… But dammit all, the resulting "bric&#8209;a&#8209;brac" was secured, and it would all be for nothing if he didn’t keep it well out of sight of the gendarmes who still had both eyes.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
    <p>The train was slowing down. He spotted the palm trees. An infallible sign. They appeared, followed by the gleaming facades.</p>

    <p>Monaco. This godforsaken cave had a knack for making you feel underdressed before you’d even arrived.</p>

    <p>Luka did not adjust his tie.</p>

    <p>Word was that the Yugoslav ambassador to France spent his time at the Bar Américain. Nothing unusual there. And probably not the spanner in the works, he thought—but you never know. Luka had learned to follow the details that seemed to protest most against any imputation of significance: it’s rarely the centerpiece that betrays you.</p>

    <p>It was February 1951. From reading too much politics and playing the journalist a bit too convincingly, Luka had gone soft—he knew it. This was the moment. Aside from everything else, he needed the money.</p>

    <p>Despite his top marks in exams, Luka had never set foot in a school for <em>pros</em>. Having bypassed the official channels, he had forged his instincts in the street, in the heart of the underworld.</p>

    <p>Why hadn’t he been chosen? In today’s world, no one ever tells you much to your face. Least of all the spooks. But he had always relished the idea of having the upper hand over those he might have called colleagues in another life. The kind who spoke in acronyms and walked as if they had secrets sewn into their linings.</p>

    <p>Officially, he was a minor hack, always hovering on the line between a scoop and a platitude. A perfect cover for a man who preferred listening to talking. But by night, so to speak, he was part of a lean team, thinned out by years, betrayals, and desertions.</p>

    <p>Three weeks of churning out fluff pieces for the paper, and finally, something was worth the effort.</p>

    <p>Not a boss. Not a pawn either.</p>

    <p>Rather, the man you called when something needed to be diverted—discreetly.</p>

    <p>Small-time embezzlements. A shipment of wine for the American army—along with the truck, sometimes. Jewelry, of course.</p>

    <p>Even a thoroughbred, once. <i>On a lark.</i></p>

    <p>Anything that moved could change destination. Goods, beasts, engines, papers—he made do with that. As long as there was a plan, and an exit.</p>

    <p>Dangerous work, but it beats <em>Special Correspondent: Dead Dog</em>.</p>

    <p>Round trip, the job takes ten days if you don’t screw up. Ten years if you do. Nine in either case, if you’re lucky—the <i>Punnett square</i> of criminality.</p>

    <p>These calculations came naturally to him. It was his tenth year in the industry, with a few holes in the CV. He had taken a sabbatical between academic rejection and full criminal commitment. Twelve months to weigh his career options.</p>

    <p>The Rue de la Gare descended toward the Place d’Armes. From the station to the square, then to the Rue Princesse&#8209;Caroline, the traveler lazily followed the natural slope.</p>

    <p>As life returned to him, he shook off the rest of his torpor, jumping onto Millo—a quick change of tracks. He stopped only for a moment before a wall fountain and, as if to ward off any imminent return of laziness, splashed his face.</p>

    <p>Luka crossed an unmarked alleyway that ran parallel to the Rue Saige, which he had just passed. He turned right.</p>

    <p>“Ruelle d. Gazomètres” on the maps—he knew it. It steered him south again. After a brief climb, it spat him back out onto the main road. The Rue du Port led him directly to the Boulevard Albert Ier.</p>

    <p>He settled into a corner café and asked for a carafe of water. Simple, discreet, and within his means. He counted his coins in his head once more. For this assignment, there was no risk of failing to play the man of modest means.</p>

    <p>The streets channeled the Monegasque people outside, toward the dim sunlight. Workers of all kinds scurried in every direction.</p>

    <p>Here, one could sit and watch the last of the fishmongers, still hosing down their stalls on the Quai du Commerce, not quite far enough away to be free of the accompanying smells.</p>

    <p>11:35 AM: Luka left a tip of half a franc.</p>

    <p>He began to climb the long flight of steps leading to the Route de la Porte&#8209;Neuve, which sweeps along the edge of the Rock.</p>

    <p>Almost at the top, he lingered, turning his head to the left to look at the breakwater. He watched the seagulls dancing in the distance, imagining himself out there while they were here. A light amusement—but it offered no inspiration. He moved on.</p>

    <p>Just before throwing travelers into the waves, the Porte&#8209;Neuve folds back at 135 degrees and becomes the relentless Avenue Saint&#8209;Martin.</p>

    <p>Luka fought against the wind, his leather bag laden with gifts—to wit, a Lyonnais sausage—swinging from his body in jerks.</p>

    <p>The wind ripped at him, heedless of his layers.</p>

    <p>He was in no hurry to arrive: whether they were too kind or were too cruel, he could not decide.</p>

    <p>The weight of the sausage pressed against the small packet of gold watch parts in the bag.</p>

    <p>The worst part is that he needs them—just this once.</p>

    <p>Ahead, undeterred by the whipping air, a wave of schoolchildren burst from the Oceanographic Museum and spilled onto the road.</p>

    <p>He took a moment, then continued.</p>

    <p>With the Museum of Anthropology—modest in size and appearance (relatively speaking, mind you)—not yet in sight, Luka turned right.</p>

    <p>Saint&#8209;Devote: a motorcycle hummed through the alley toward the Rue Émile-de-Loth, its tires bouncing over a surface of imperturbable placidity.</p>

    <p>Luka crossed the Place de la Mairie—a great urban confluence—just as a bell tolled noon.</p>

    <p>A handful of the faithful swirled around the doors of the Chapel of Mercy.</p>

    <p>Rue (Princesse Marie) de Lorraine—who could forget it.</p>

    <p>Then, the Rue de l’Orphelinat, an aptly named street, as he would soon discover.</p>

    <p>His wanderings culminated at the Rue de Lorète, a thin, silent artery serving as a <i>cordon sanitaire</i> between the orphanage—massive, looming—and the neighboring houses allied with the rear of the chapel, as if a ceasefire had been imposed mere seconds before he turned the corner.</p>

    <p>The tall house of his former love.</p>

    <p>He had arrived.</p>
